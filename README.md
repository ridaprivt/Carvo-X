# Carvo X: 3D Vehicle Model Extraction Application



## Introduction

Welcome to Carvo X, an innovative application that enables users to extract 3D models for any vehicle's interior and exterior. With a simple video recording of the vehicle's interior and exterior, Modula's amazing algorithm processes the video to create a visually appealing and interactive 3D model representation.

## Features

- :video_camera: **Video Input:** Modula offers two methods for video input:
    - Video recording on runtime, allowing users to capture the vehicle's interior and exterior in real-time.
    - Import videos from the local storage of the mobile phone.

- :file_folder: **3D Model Storage:** The generated 3D models can be stored:
    - Locally on the user's device, providing the option to create and manage a personal collection of models in a specific directory.
    - On the cloud, enabling users to access their models from any device with an internet connection.

- :busts_in_silhouette: **User Signup and Login:** Users can sign up and log in to Modula using their preferred method, including Google login/signup.

- :bar_chart: **View Recent Models:** Users can view their most recently generated 3D models for easy access.

- :pencil2: **Profile Editing:** Users have the ability to customize their profile:
    - Upload a custom profile picture to personalize their account.
    - Choose a unique username to be displayed in the application.

## Pages

Carvo X consists of the following pages:
